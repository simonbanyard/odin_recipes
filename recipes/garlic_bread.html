		<p>Get the kids in the kitchen to make this simple side dish - pop any extra garlic butter into the fridge or freezer for a busy weeknight.</p>
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>60g butter, softened</li>
			<li>2 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
			<li>1 part-baked white baguette (about 150g)</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Method</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Put the butter in a bowl, add the garlic and mix well. Spoon the butter out onto a sheet of cling film and roll up to make a sausage-shaped log. Chill for 10 mins.</li>
			<li>Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Slice the baguette into about 12 slices but not all the way through, leaving the base intact to hold it together.</li>
			<li>Remove the cling film from the butter and thinly slice on a chopping board. Press each butter slice between the slices of bread.</li>
			<li>Wrap the baguette in foil, place on a tray and bake for 5–6 mins, then peel back the foil. Cook for a further 4–5 mins to crisp up.</li>
		</ol>
